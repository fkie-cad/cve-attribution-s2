# cve-attribution-s2

This repository is a companion to the paper:

```plain
Towards Reliable and Scalable Linux Kernel CVE Attribution in Automated Static Firmware Analyses
```

It provides stage two of the proposed static bug attribution pipeline for linux kernel CVEs, consisting of two general packages:

1. The [cve-attribution-s2](cve-attribution-s2) script to apply our enriched version-based attribution, and ...
2. ... the [nvd-database](nvd-database) component that serves CVE data. It is a self-updating docker container that harvests NVD json feeds and provides them in a mongodb instance listening on `127.0.0.1:28000`

Each package has its own subfolder, a corresponding `README.md` and setup guidelines. General usage is as follows:

1. Reconstruct the Home Router Security Report 2020 [firmware corpus](https://github.com/fkie-cad/embedded-evaluation-corpus/blob/master/2020/FKIE-HRS-2020.md) used in our case study. (We can not just re-distribute copyrighted firmware images, sorry)
2. Execute stage one: Analyze the corpus with [FACT](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core), enable the analysis plugins `kernel_config`, `architecture_detection`, and `software_components`
3. Start the `nvd-database`, wait until it is fully seeded
4. Apply the `cve-attribution-s2` script to generate `output_*.json` files. Their respective names correspond to the filter verdict confidence scale used in our paper
